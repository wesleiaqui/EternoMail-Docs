# Other Email Providers

Aerion supports many email providers beyond Gmail and Outlook. This guide covers setup for pre-configured providers and manual configuration.

3. Enter your email address
4. Enter your password or app password
5. Configure server settings:

### IMAP Settings (Incoming Mail)

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Server | Your IMAP server hostname (e.g., `mail.example.com`) |
| Port | Usually 993 (SSL) or 143 (STARTTLS) |
| Security | SSL/TLS or STARTTLS |
| Username | Usually your full email address |

### SMTP Settings (Outgoing Mail)

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Server | Your SMTP server hostname (e.g., `smtp.example.com`) |
| Port | Usually 465 (SSL) or 587 (STARTTLS) |
| Security | SSL/TLS or STARTTLS |
| Username | Usually your full email address |

### Common Server Settings

| Provider | IMAP Server | SMTP Server |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Generic | imap.domain.com:993 | smtp.domain.com:465 |

Contact your email provider or system administrator for the correct server settings.

## Testing Your Connection

After entering your settings, Aerion will attempt to connect to the server. If the connection fails:

1. Double-check the server hostname and port
2. Verify your username and password
3. Ensure the security setting matches your server's requirements
4. Check if your firewall is blocking the connection

## Troubleshooting

### "Connection Refused" Error

- Verify the server hostname is correct
- Check if the port is correct (993 for IMAP SSL, 465 or 587 for SMTP)
- Ensure your firewall allows outbound connections on these ports

### "Authentication Failed" Error

- Confirm your username (usually your full email address)
- Ensure you're using an app password if 2FA is enabled
- Check if your provider requires enabling IMAP access in settings

### "Certificate Error"

- Ensure the security setting matches your server
- For self-signed certificates, you may need to add an exception
- Contact your server administrator for the correct SSL/TLS settings
