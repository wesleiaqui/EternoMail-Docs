## How Focus Works

Aerion has three main panes:

1. **Sidebar** - Account and folder list
2. **Message List** - Conversations in the current folder
3. **Conversation Viewer** - The selected conversation

A visual indicator shows which pane is focused. Use `Alt+Left/Right` or `Alt+H/L` to move focus between panes.

## Bulk Selection

To apply actions to multiple messages:

1. Navigate to a message with `J/K`
2. Press `Space` to check it
3. Navigate to more messages and check them
4. Apply an action (e.g., `Delete`, `Ctrl+K` for archive)

Or use `Shift+J/K` to select while navigating.

Press `Escape` to clear all selections.

## Action Priority

When you use an action shortcut:

1. If any messages are **checked**, the action applies to all checked messages
2. Otherwise, the action applies to the **keyboard-focused** message in the list

This lets you quickly act on single messages or perform bulk operations.


## Extensions

Extension shortcuts only fire when the corresponding extension is the active rail pane (selected via `Ctrl+Tab` / `` Ctrl+` ``). They never trigger while Mail is active — so shortcuts that overlap with Mail's (like `Ctrl+N`, `Ctrl+Shift+A`, `Ctrl+Shift+S`) are unambiguous: the active rail decides which handler runs. For example, `Ctrl+Shift+A` syncs accounts in Mail, syncs all calendar sources in Calendar, and syncs all contact sources in Contacts.

Pane-local navigation (Up/Down/J/K, Enter, Space, Alt+H/L for pane cycling, Alt+Up/Down for sidebar) uses the same kit-shared predicates Mail does — they're listed per-extension below for completeness, but they're not extension-specific re-implementations.

### Calendar

**Navigation (pane cycling)**

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Alt+Left` / `Alt+H` | Focus previous pane |
| `Alt+Right` / `Alt+L` | Focus next pane |

**Date / view navigation**

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `T` | Jump the calendar view to today |
| `←` | Previous view-unit (prev month / week / day) |
| `→` | Next view-unit (next month / week / day) |
| `Alt+M` | Switch to month view |
| `Alt+W` | Switch to week view |
| `Alt+D` | Switch to day view |
| `Alt+A` | Switch to agenda view |

**Actions**

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+N` | Open the new-event composer |
| `Ctrl+R` | Sync all calendar sources |
| `Ctrl+Shift+A` | Sync all calendar sources (same chord as Mail's "sync all accounts" — fires whichever handler matches the active rail) |
| `F` | Toggle focus mode for the selected event |

> The calendar sidebar uses checkbox toggles per calendar (not single-select navigation), so it doesn't follow the kit's `J`/`K` row-cycling pattern. Clicking a checkbox or row in the sidebar toggles visibility.

### Contacts

**Sidebar navigation (works from any pane)**

Mirrors mail's "Folder Navigation" shortcuts. These fire regardless of which contacts pane currently has keyboard focus — so you can scroll through addressbooks while the list or detail pane is focused.

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Alt+Up` / `Alt+K` | Move to previous source / addressbook in the sidebar |
| `Alt+Down` / `Alt+J` | Move to next source / addressbook in the sidebar |

**Pane cycling**

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Alt+Left` / `Alt+H` | Focus previous pane (detail → list → sidebar) |
| `Alt+Right` / `Alt+L` | Focus next pane (sidebar → list → detail) |

**Actions**

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `E` | Edit the currently-focused contact |
| `Ctrl+N` | Open the new-contact dialog (pre-targeted to the sidebar-focused addressbook; falls back to local when the focused source isn't writable) |
| `Ctrl+Shift+A` | Sync all contact sources (same chord as Mail's "sync all accounts" — fires whichever handler matches the active rail) |
| `Ctrl+Shift+S` | Sync the contact source currently focused in the sidebar (no-op with warning toast when a built-in entry like "All" / "Local" is focused) |

> Within a focused pane, `Up`/`K` and `Down`/`J` cycle rows (contact list, sidebar sources) and `Enter` opens / activates — same kit predicates Mail's list and folder tree use.
