### Dark mail content

Apply a dark filter to email message content when Aerion is in dark mode.

There are two schools of preferences for dark mode. One is to have dark UI but light e-mail content and the other is to have everything in dark mode. This setting provides a way for the user to choose which school they belong to.

When this toggle is turned on, each message will render in dark mode and have a ☀️ icon on the right side of the header which you can click on to temporarily render the email in light mode in case the dark mode filter breaks the e-mail rendering.

### Dark composer body

Use a dark background for the composer message body when Aerion is in dark mode.

By default, the e-mail content inside the conversation viewer will always have a white background. However, if you prefer having a dark background when using a dark theme, you can turn this setting on.

### Always show checkbox next to message

Reserve a fixed checkbox column in the message list instead of revealing it on hover or swipe.

By default, inside the message list column, the area where the checkbox on the left of the message is located is covered by the message and on mouseover, the message will shift to the right and show that area. In mobile layout, swiping to the right will auto select the message which solves the problem of not being able to do mouse over on a mobile device. If you prefer the original design where the checkbox area is always shown with the checkboxes always visiable in mobile layout, toggle this setting on.

### Show colored circles in message list

Show colored circles with sender initials in the message list.

Enabled by default.

This is where you can disable the colored contact circles on the message list of Aerion to get a more minimalistic look especially if you don't feel like you get value from the color contact circles.

### Show colored circles in conversation viewer

Show colored circles with sender initials in the conversation viewer.

Enabled by default.

This is where you can disable the colored contact circles in the conversation viewer if you think the contact circles are unneccesary noise.

### Show contact photos in message list

Show the contact's profile picture (falling back to a colored circle) in the message list. Requires "Show colored circles in message list".

### Accent bar for unread messages

This puts a left side bar marker based on your themes secondary color to each unread message for better visual grepping of what's read and unread if enabled. This feature is disabled by default. The only difference between read and unread is bold versus normal text by default (when disabled).

### Message Density

Control how compact the message list appears:

- **Micro** - Minimal spacing, maximum messages visible
- **Compact** - Reduced spacing
- **Standard** - Default balanced spacing
- **Large** - More spacing for easier reading

### Auto-Mark as Read

Set how long a message must be viewed before marking it as read:

- **Immediately** - Mark read as soon as opened
- **After 1 second**
- **After 2 seconds**
- **After 5 seconds**
- **Never** - Only mark read manually

### Background

**Run in background** - Enable this if you want Aerion to not exit but run in the background when you close the Aerion window. This setting is also a pre-requisite for the next toggle to be enabled.
**Starts hidden on launch** - Enable this if you want Aerion to launch in the background on first launch without showing the window.

### Startup

**Autostart on login** - Enable this if you want Aerion to automatically launch when you login to your system.

### Tray Icon

Tray icon has not been implemented yet but is in the roadmap down the road.

## Composer Tab
---

- **Never send** - Ignore all read receipt requests

### Spellcheck

This is the configuration for the spellcheck functionality. Currently, spellcheck only supports languages that use Latin alphabet. Spellcheck with the English language is turned on by default. You can turn this feature completely off by toggling it off. If you need spellcheck support for languages other than English, toggle the language you need on under the **Dictionary** sub-section. Here are the currently supported languages:

- English
- Čeština
- Deutsch
- Français
- Italiano
- Norsk Bokmål

## Extensions
---

This is a 1st party extension system. It doesn't allow for community or 3rd party development of extensions yet. Whether or not the extension system will be opened up to the community or 3rd parties will depend on future demands. Currently, the extension system is meant to make it possible for Aerion to stay a lightweight e-mail only client but at the same time be able to provide features that only specific power users want such as contacts management, calendar management and more in the future.

In this tab, you can enable **Contacts** and/or **Calendar** extensions. Each extension has its own settings dialog. To learn more, see the [Extensions](/docs/features/extensions) section.

## About Tab
---

View information about Aerion:

- **Version** - Current Aerion version
- **GitHub** - Link to source code and issues
- **Privacy Policy** - How Aerion handles your data
- **Terms of Use** - Usage terms

## Applying Changes
---

Most settings take effect immediately. Some changes (like adding accounts or contact sources) may require a sync before you see results.

## Configuration Location
---

Aerion stores configuration in your system's standard application data location:

| Platform | Location |
|----------|----------|
| Linux | `~/.config/aerion/` or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/aerion/` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/aerion/` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\aerion\` |

:::warning
Modifying configuration files directly is not recommended. Use the Settings UI instead.
:::

## Notifications
---

By default on Linux, Aerion uses `org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop` but if you launch Aerion from the terminal, notifications will not work. In those cases, you will want to use the `--dbus-notify` flag to launch Aerion.
